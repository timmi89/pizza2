Description

This application encourages the user to choose from a series of toppings checkboxes and a size dropdown menu, in order to create their own pizza.

Setup/Installation Requirements

It would be helpful for the user to have
a GitHub account and an internet connection.
If you would like to amend this project, please be aware that it uses Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, so access to those files will be most helpful.

Known Bugs

There was a mix up with some of the code, and if anyone is savvy enough they will be able to print a list of the user's chosen toppings along with the size and price.
